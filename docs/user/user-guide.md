## Windows GUI Version

The Windows GUI version provides a modern graphical interface with additional features.

### Getting Started

Choose the version that best fits your system and preferences:

### Console Version (`pong` or `pong.exe`)

The console version runs in any terminal and is perfect for:

- Ball speed increases slightly with each paddle hit
- Paddle movement affects ball direction and spin

## Troubleshooting

### Console Version Issues

**Game doesn't respond to keys:**

- Make sure the terminal window has focus
- Try pressing keys more deliberately
- On some systems, try Ctrl+C to exit if stuck

**Display looks garbled:**

- Try resizing your terminal window
- Ensure your terminal supports ANSI escape sequences
- Try a different terminal program

**Build issues:**

- Make sure you have CMake 3.10+ installed
- For Windows, use Visual Studio or MSVC compiler
- For Linux, ensure g++ or clang++ supports C++17

### Windows GUI Issues

**Window appears blank or unresponsive:**

- Try running the console version to check for error messages
- Update your graphics drivers
- Try running as administrator

**High DPI display problems:**

- The game should automatically handle DPI scaling
- If text appears blurry, check Windows display scaling settings
- Try running in compatibility mode for older Windows versions

**Settings not saving:**

- Check that the game directory is writable
- Look for `settings.json` and `highscores.json` files
- Try running as administrator if needed

**Performance issues:**

- Close other applications to free up system resources
- The game is lightweight and should run on most systems
- Try adjusting Windows visual effects settings

### General Issues

**Game runs too fast or slow:**

- The game uses real-time physics with automatic frame timing
- Very old or very new systems might need different timing
- Try closing other applications

**Controls feel unresponsive:**

- Ensure the game window has focus
- Try switching between keyboard and mouse modes (GUI version)
- Check that no other applications are capturing input

## Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the console version first - it often provides error messages
2. Ensure you have the latest Visual C++ redistributables (Windows)
3. Try running the game from a command prompt to see error output
4. Check that antivirus software isn't blocking the game

## Advanced Usage

### Command Line Options

Currently, the games don't accept command line parameters, but you can:

- Run multiple instances for testing
- Use different directories for separate configurations
- Create shortcuts with specific working directories

### File Locations

**Settings file:** `settings.json` (same directory as executable)
**High scores:** `highscores.json` (same directory as executable)

These files use human-readable JSON format and can be edited manually if needed.

### Building from Source

See the main README.md for complete build instructions. The game can be compiled on Windows, Linux, and other POSIX-compatible systems.
